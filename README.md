### Installation
This will eventually be an npm package.  It is not currently published.  It will be soon :)

### Usage
This assumes that you've been able to get this from npm....which you currently can't. If you know how to use npm then you'd know how to fork this and include `stoopidwallet.js` anyway, so let's just assume you've installed this from npm or can otherwise modify the instructions yourself.  That way I don't have to entirely re-write this later.

First you're going to want to include the package and declare the class
```javascript
var StoopidWallet = require("../src/stoopidwallet");
var stoopidwallet = new StoopidWallet();
```
